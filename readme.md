This is the actual Laravel project using USWDS as a CSS framework. 

This application is used in conjunction with my ME(A)N web service project; albeit with no Angular involved.

Currently this applicaton is using a custom authentication provider to work in conjunction with the web service. Features haven't been completely implemented; currently, authentication is only required to view single posts from the /posts archive page. To demo this capability the following user account can be used : Eric2 / password.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

### License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

### Extra

Note - this project requires users to run 'composer install' in the working directory as well as creating an .env file.
